I have baked a custom integration to control Eufy Security Cameras and access RTSP (real time streaming protocol) and P2P (peer to peer) stream if possible. Integration supports doorbells, cameras, home bases, motion and contact sensors and it is far from complete. 

Under the hood, it is using `eufy-security-ws` (https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-ws) web socket application which uses `eufy-security-client` (https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-client) to communicate with eufy servers and devices over cloud and peer to peer connection. So, I am following versioning of `eufy-security-ws` directly as add-on version.

**Big thanks to @bropat who made this possible. Please consider buying a coffee for him over here: https://ko-fi.com/bropat**

# 1. Services #
## 1.1 Camera Services ##
- start_rtsp_livestream / stop_rtsp_livestream (RTSP): **if your camera can stream over RTSP, please enable it over eufy app, this is more more reliable and less power consuming and you can use these services to start and stop stream.**. This service starts a new stream using RTSP. Currently, it is limited to one stream per home assistant. https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-client/issues/63
- start_livesteam / start_p2p_livestream / stop_livestream / stop_p2p_livestream (P2P): if there is no support for RTSP, you can use P2P streaming, this should work for all camera types but much more power consuming for your HA instance.
- turn_on / turn_off: it first checks **if there is rtsp attribute in camera and if yes; it will use RTSP services,** if not, it will use P2P services.
- enable_rtsp / disable_rtsp: to enable RTSP option in cameras, you can use this services, but I rather prefer you to enable it using the mobile app because enabling rtsp configuration also triggers a new stream to start which causes issues for integration.
- enable / disable: enable and disable respective device

## 1.2 Station Services ##
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11085566/127906780-ba18d5a0-03c3-407a-922a-dc519e59dfe8.png)
- alarm_arm_home / alarm_arm_away / alarm_disarm / alarm_guard_schedule (requires configuration on eufy app) / alarm_guard_geo (requires configuration on eufy app)
- alarm_arm_custom1 / alarm_arm_custom2 / alarm_arm_custom3 - you need to create custom configurations for these to work
- alarm_trigger / alarm_trigger_with_duration - trigger alarm on home station
- reset_alarm - stop the alarm state

## 1.3 Other Devices ##
Locks (not the Wifi), motion and contact sensors are supported and native services can be used.

## 1.4 Integration Services ##
- force_sync - get latest changes from cloud as some changes are not generating notifications to be captured automatically

# 2. Known Bugs / Issues / Supported Devices #
Check here: https://github.com/fuatakgun/eufy_security/issues
Supported devices: https://github.com/bropat/eufy-security-client#known-working-devices

# 3. Troubleshooting
1- **Create a separate account for HA integration as that account will be logged out automatically from mobile app when HA integration logged in. Do not forget to share your cameras with your new account (preferably with adming rights), enable motion notifications with full picture and enable push notifications. This integration depends on push notifications to catch any updates.**

2- RTSP - As of now, live stream is limited to 3 minutes and this is a hard limitation by Eufy, so we do not have a solution in place. So, if you keep live stream running more than 3 minutes, it will be turned off by hardware but **home assistant will not be notified on this**. So, next time you want to start live stream, you notice that nothing will be happening as we assume that it is already running. As a workaround, please call stop and start in order. https://github.com/fuatakgun/eufy_security/issues/10#issuecomment-886251442 

3- P2P - To have P2P streaming work out, we have an additional add-on to mirror incoming video bytes and stream as it is an RTSP stream. But to do so, integration first needs to analyze X seconds from incmoing bytes to understand video codec information (dimensions, fps, codec etc) and then initializes the stream on add-on. So, depending on your hardware and video quality (**please always set STREAMING QUALITY, CODEC and COMPRESSION to LOW**) this could change between 1 to 5 seconds. I am able to stream more than 15 minutes for my 2C cameras using P2P. If your P2P stream fails to start, please play with this configuration in integration options page. Check below image;

4- Please do not enable `Preload Stream` functionality in Camera View if your camera is battery powered (not streaming all the time) for two reasons; it is not adding functionality in our use case and it sends a signal to enable live stream to your cameras which might end up excessive battery consumption.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11085566/128697823-f83b5ce5-1f31-48c9-ac6d-712bd56b504b.png)

5- One user reported that there is an issue regarding to 2k Battery Doorbell in terms of receiving motion and person detection sensor. If you are having a similar issue, please apply this solution: https://github.com/fuatakgun/eufy_security/issues/22#issuecomment-908157691

6- I am more than happy to debug individual issues as long as you follow setup instructions. I need you to share your problematic cameras with me so that I can use my own machine to debug the issue. For each debugging request, please create a github issue so we can track from there. Do not forget to remove the sharing settings after we are done :)

- If you are located in EU, use my account: `fuatakgun@gmail.com`
- If you are located in US, use shared test account: `eufydeveloper@gmail.com`

6- If you have any other issue, please create it an issue on github repository, give information about your home assistant hardware, camera model, streaming type (rtsp or p2p), steps required to generate the issue. Enable excessive logging and share your logs from integration and related add ons.

```
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.eufy_security: debug
```

# 6. Installation
***Warning, there is an existing integration (https://github.com/nonsleepr/ha-eufy-security) and I have used the same internal name with this integration, unintentinally. You can not keep both integrations and trying to install might cause issues. You can backup old one if you want to test this, just rename `custom_components/eufy_security` into something else (eg `eufy_security_nonsleepr`)***

Please follow screenshots below. In summary;
- You will first install HASS Add On assuming you are running on Hassos or Supervised. If not, please execute this command to run docker instance manually ```docker run -it -e USERNAME=email@address.com -e PASSWORD=password_goes_here -p 3000:3000 bropat/eufy-security-ws:X.Y.Z```. To find out correct values for X.Y.Z, please chek here https://github.com/fuatakgun/eufy_security_addon/blob/main/config.json#L3
- Later on, you should install RTSP Server Add On to have faster/more reliable p2p streaming. I will deprecate/not support file based streaming soon, so, please migrate in timely manner. If you are not using Hassos or Supervised installation please execute this command to run docker instance manually ```docker run --rm -it -e RTSP_PROTOCOLS=tcp -d -p 8554:8554 -p 1935:1935 aler9/rtsp-simple-server```
- When you are done with HASS Add On, you will install integration via HACS, downloading files over UI, restarting home assistant and setting up integration.
- Double check if your `configuration.yaml` includes `ffmpeg` integration. If not, please do like this; https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ffmpeg/#configuration . This integration relies on `ffmpeg` to be setup to live stream via P2P and capture images from live RTSP/P2P streams.

6- In next page, use ```localhost``` if you have used Add-on installation, otherwise put your Docker instance ip address and keep `3000` as port

![12-integration-configure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11085566/126563976-234005e7-2920-4ef0-a301-187d4d929f10.png)

7- You will be shown devices connected to your account. Or you can be alerted with captcha notification.

![13-integration-done](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11085566/126563982-38b3a00a-ff6a-45aa-8dcc-b04e864a37f8.PNG)

8- Follow screenshots below for captcha
a. Get notified about captcha request
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11085566/145604195-7b5499b3-9603-468b-aa03-84121047719b.png)

b. Go to Integrations Page and click `RECONFIGURE`
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11085566/145604271-3cfd3a5a-a6ba-42dc-8b9b-b0f8e759c8b2.png)

c. Enter the correct code and click `Submit` (I will put wrong intentionally)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11085566/145604402-7f5f0feb-339a-49d8-b97f-f136ddf5121b.png)

d. If you put the wrong code, after couple of seconds, you will get a similar error in Integrations page, but this time, `RECONFIGURE` button will be missing. Please Disable and Enable back the integration to get the respective option again. (Working on a better solution)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11085566/145604673-c1a8e17a-0969-4d8d-a0df-647ce5c36741.png)

e. After entering correct captcha code, your devices will be ready to use.

9- If your camera does not support RTSP based live streaming, you can use `Start Live Stream` and `Stop Live Stream` services rather than turn_on and turn_off because they tend to be using RTSP functions. They require camera entities as input, you can use UI for this. More importantly, please set your `Streaming Quality` settings to `Low` per each camera using Eufy Security app, otherwise WebRTC will fail to stream the video. Underlying issue is realted mid or high quality codecs are not supported by WebRTC.

![14-services-live-stream](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11085566/126563991-5ef949c5-144c-4702-a9e3-577e2d37c0f8.PNG)

10- If you want faster P2P live streaming, go to Integration Configuration section and enable it.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11085566/127866543-1345d56f-b4f3-4154-96c7-a278d747cf8d.png)

## 6.3 WebRTC - Required

You can use WebRTC for light speed streaming inside Home Assistant.

1- Install WebRTC following these steps: https://github.com/AlexxIT/WebRTC#installation

2- Disable Auto Start on Click to be sure that cameras are not starting to stream autoamtically.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11085566/136706616-7ba09fec-f75b-4010-b58e-bf0f8f2d47da.png)

3- Setup two conditional cards for each camera as below, do not forget to put correct camera entity names (replace `front` with your camera name)
- So, when camera is not streaming, you will get latest captured image and when you click on image, it will start streaming (camera.turn_on service call).
- When camera is streaming, you will get WebRTC card which has 1-2 seconds latency while streaming.

```
type: grid
square: false
cards:
  - type: conditional
    conditions:
      - entity: binary_sensor.front_streaming_sensor
        state: 'False'
    card:
      type: picture-entity
      entity: camera.front
      tap_action:
        action: call-service
        service: camera.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: camera.front
  - type: conditional
    conditions:
      - entity: binary_sensor.front_streaming_sensor
        state: 'True'
    card:
      type: vertical-stack
      cards:
        - type: custom:webrtc-camera
          entity: camera.front
        - type: button
          name: Stop Streaming
          show_state: false
          show_icon: false
          tap_action:
            action: call-service
            service: camera.turn_off
            target:
              entity_id: camera.front
columns: 1
```
